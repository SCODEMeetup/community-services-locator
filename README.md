## Overview
Donatos is partnering with Smart Columbus and the Reeb Center to help people find and access
Community Services. Donatos is interested in making a visualization available to their employees through
their communications app and potentially on an iPad at the Reeb Center. Donatoâ€™s managers will have
access to the Community Services Application to find services for their employees and give them a bus
passes to get there.

## Objective
Using the provided datasets, build an interactive map that can display locations of active service
providers. Users should be able to navigate the map by location, service provider, and service
offerings.

The visualization can be built using the tooling or the framework of your choice. Ideally, the
resulting artifact should be capable of being accessed via web hosting (for a web app, for
example), or through an API (To be consumed by a mobile application).

## Timeline
Completed visualizations must be submitted to Tammy Chellis by December 15. Submit your
finished product via SCODE GitHub.
